### [MYDFIR Guided Steps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5OessbOgyEo&list=PLG6KGSNK4PuBWmX9NykU0wnWamjxdKhDJ&index=13)

<h2>Description</h2>
Designed and implemented an Active Directory home lab to simulate enterprise-level environments, integrating Splunk for real-time monitoring and log analysis. Leveraged Kali Linux for penetration testing and vulnerability assessments and utilized Atomic Red Team to execute adversary emulation scenarios. This comprehensive setup demonstrates hands-on experience in security operations, threat detection, and incident response.

<h2>Objective Overview</h2>
I aim to leverage my hands-on experience in cybersecurity through a home lab environment, including Active Directory, Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team, to enhance my skills in threat detection, security monitoring, and incident response. I aim to apply this knowledge professionally to protect organizational assets and ensure robust security measures against evolving cyber threats.

<h2>Skills Learned</h2>

  - Active Directory Administration: Configured and managed an enterprise-like environment, including user/group policies and access control.
  - Log Analysis with Splunk: Monitored, analyzed, and visualized log data to identify and respond to security incidents.
  - Penetration Testing: Used Kali Linux to perform vulnerability assessments, network scanning, and ethical hacking.
  - Threat Simulation: Executed adversary techniques using Atomic Red Team to understand attack patterns and improve defenses.
  - Incident Response: Practiced detecting, analyzing, and responding to simulated security breaches.
  - Security Operations: Strengthened understanding of SIEM tools, intrusion detection, and mitigation strategies.
  - Technical Problem-Solving: Identified and resolved technical challenges within a self-built and managed lab environment.
  - Hands-On Security Skills: Gained real-world experience in threat emulation, log correlation, and risk assessment in a controlled lab.

<h2>Tools Used</h2>

- Active Directory: This simulates enterprise network environments and manages users, groups, and policies.
- Splunk: For real-time log collection, analysis, and security event monitoring.
- Kali Linux is for penetration testing, vulnerability assessment, and ethical hacking exercises.
- Atomic Red Team: This is used to execute adversary emulation and test detection capabilities.
- Windows Server: This is used to set up and manage domain controllers and group policies.
- PowerShell: This is for the Active Directory's scripting, automation, and advanced management tasks.
- Wireshark: This is for network traffic analysis and troubleshooting.
- Nmap: This is for network discovery and vulnerability scanning.
- Metasploit: For advanced exploitation and testing of system defenses.
- Virtualization Tools: VMware or VirtualBox for managing the lab environment.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
Building and managing this home lab has allowed me to gain practical, hands-on experience with enterprise-grade tools and techniques in a controlled environment. I have developed a strong foundation in cybersecurity operations by integrating Active Directory, Splunk, Kali Linux, and Atomic Red Team, including threat detection, vulnerability assessment, and incident response. This experience demonstrates my ability to simulate real-world scenarios, troubleshoot complex issues, and implement effective security solutions, preparing me to contribute to protecting organizational assets professionally.
